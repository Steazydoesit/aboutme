    <p class="course-p">
      Information networks and computers play a vital role in every facet of our lives and are critical to the global economy, civil infrastructure, and military power. These networks, however, and the data that travels upon them, are under constant and increasing attack from foreign nations, terrorist organizations, and organized crime groups.   This course will focus on the evolution of cyber crime, cyber warfare and cyber terrorism—it will include a discussion of how state and non-state actors utilize this form of asymmetrical warfare to infiltrate government and corporate networks and how cyber and enterprise risk management professionals can learn to more effectively respond to this critical emerging risk.
