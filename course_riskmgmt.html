    <p class="course-p">
      Information networks and computers play a vital role in every facet of our lives and are critical to the global economy, civil infrastructure, and military power. These networks, however, and the data that travels upon them, are under constant and increasing attack from foreign nations, terrorist organizations, and organized crime groups.   This course will focus on the evolution of cyber crime, cyber warfare and cyber terrorism—it will include a discussion of how state and non-state actors utilize this form of asymmetrical warfare to infiltrate government and corporate networks and how cyber and enterprise risk management professionals can learn to more effectively respond to this critical emerging risk.

    <h1 class="course-h1">How it's going</h1>
    <p class="course-p">So far, this course has focused on an important question: Who governs cyberspace?  We have looked into the concepts of multilateralism and multistakeholderism and seen that in reality, cyberspace governance can never really be solely one or the other, but must rather exist in a realm within the two.  We have then begun examining various cybersecurity risk management frameworks such as NIST and ISO 27001, and comparing the pros and cons of each.  We are just now beginning a cyber "War game", where various groups of students will pose as either countries or industries (such as energy or financial) and attempt to attack and prevent against other groups in cyber warfare.
