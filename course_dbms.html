    <p class="course-p">The success of today’s business often hinges on the ability to utilize critical information to make the right decisions quickly and efficiently. Transforming mountains of data into critical information to improve decision making is a skill every business decision maker must possess. This focus course covers the database design topics with a focus on enabling business decision making. Detailed topics include collecting, capturing, querying, and manipulating data (using SQL) for simple to medium complex business applications. Commercial database products are utilized to demonstrate the design of database applications in management, marketing, finance, accounting, and other business areas. Students will be able to design and implement simple to medium complex database applications after successful completion of this course.</p>

    <h1 class="course-h1">How'd it go?</h1>
    <p class="course-p">This class looked at the development of a SQL database utilizing Microsoft's SQL Server Management Studio through the eyes of a database developer (rather than that of a database administrator).  We learned a broad range of topics beginning with overall databse architechture and understanding referential integrity and normalization through the various Normal Forms and ended with generating the Stored Procedures that would be used by the database user to get data out of the database in a useful manner.  Concepts such as indexing, user defined functions, nested subqueries, and views were all strong components of this course.

    <h1 class="course-h1">What type of work I did</h1>
    <p class="course-p">The main project of this course was to generate a fictional database for a fictional company of our choosing.  I chose to create a non-profit food bank called "City of Denver Food Bank".  I created a transactional database for this company that contained tables that would house information such as their warehouse and storefront locations, inventory held within, donors, recipients, as well as employees and their timesheets.  As the goal was to setup the database for the company to use, a set of Stored Procedures were also setup to allow the database users easy functionality.  Views were also created to enforce confidentiality issues, such as preventing the average database user from being able to see the SSN of other employees (or to even know that data exists in the first place).  User Defined Functions were created in order to be able to organize and display the data in a more visually appealing manner.  Last, various reports were generated through the reporting software Tableau.  When creating databases, it is important to remember that those often in charge of making decisions based on the data don't have time to scroll through tables containing large volumes of data, so this course stressed the importance on using Tableau to generate visuals that told quick stories about what the data represented.  A link to this fictional database can be found on my Github, <a href="https://github.com/Steazydoesit/Sample-SQL-Database" target='_blank'>here.</a>
